Ben to run this you need node.js installed, find it online, shouldn't be too hard to install

To run it:
1. install node.js
2. I had something here originally, but I don't think it's needed
3. start the app
3.1. cd into personal-site
3.2. run "npm install"
3.3. run "npm run dev"
3.4. follow the link

that should run it for you, feel free to use mine as a template
